/**566. Reshape the Matrix
 * In MATLAB, there is a very useful function called 'reshape',
 * which can reshape a matrix into a new one with different size but keep its original data.
 *
 * You're given a matrix represented by a two-dimensional array,
 * and two positive integers r and c representing
 * the row number and column number of the wanted reshaped matrix, respectively.
 *
 * The reshaped matrix need to be filled with all the elements of the
 * original matrix in the same row-traversing order as they were.
 *
 * If the 'reshape' operation with given parameters
 * is possible and legal, output the new reshaped matrix;
 * Otherwise, output the original matrix.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input:
 * nums =
 *     [[1, 2],
 *      [3, 4]]
 * r = 1, c = 4
 * Output: [[1, 2, 3, 4]]
 * Explanation: The row - traversing of nums is[1, 2, 3, 4].
 *              The new reshaped matrix is a 1 * 4 matrix, 
 *              fill it row by row by using the previous list.
 * Example 2:
 * Input:
 * nums =
 * [[1, 2],
 * [3, 4]]
 * r = 2, c = 4
 * Output: [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
 * Explanation: There is no way to reshape a 2 * 2 matrix to a 2 * 4 matrix.
 *              So output the original matrix.
 * @param { number[][] } nums
 * @param { number } r
 * @param { number } c
 * @return { number[][] }
